"""
A "cog" is a class that contains commands and event listeners that are added to the bot when they are loaded.
And this is basically all about the contents in this directory.

Every folder represents a "Category" for commands. Inside the `__init__.py`, create a docstring describing
the category for the help command.

Then feel free to create as many files as you want and add classes containing all your commands and events.
But never forget a `setup` function that calls `add_cog` on the actual cog(s).
